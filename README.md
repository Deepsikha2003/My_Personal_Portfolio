Project Name: My Personal Portfolio
This is a clean, modern, and responsive personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background.

Technologies Used
The website is built using the following core web technologies:

HTML5: For the semantic structure of the website.

CSS3: For all the styling, including animations, responsive design, and the overall visual aesthetic.

External Libraries & Resources
To enhance the design and functionality, the project incorporates a few external resources:

Google Fonts: The website uses the following fonts from Google Fonts for a clean and elegant typography:

Playfair Display: Used for titles (h1, h2) to provide a sophisticated, italicized, and artistic look.

Roboto: A simple, clean, and highly readable sans-serif font used for body text and other content.

Font Awesome: The icons on the details.html page (e.g., for GitHub, LinkedIn, email) are provided by Font Awesome, a popular icon toolkit. This allows for visually appealing and recognizable social media links.

Placeholder Images: The images used in the hero section are placeholders. To complete the website, you should replace these with your own high-quality, professional photographs.
